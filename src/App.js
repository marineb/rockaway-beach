    <p>
      This project makes up for the lack of information available on Rockaway Beach. We thought it would be helpful to have a simple list of all the great activities you can do there.
    </p>

    <p>We're currently designing a line of socks to help you bring the beach to the office. <a href="http://eepurl.com/ca5HSL" target="_blank">Give us your email</a> and we'll let you know when the socks are here!</p>

    <h1>Beaches</h1>

    <p>Stretching for miles along the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, Rockaway Beach is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockaway_Beach,_Queens" target="_blank">largest urban beach in the United States</a>. Itâ€™s easy to get there via public transportation. These are the best spots to visit:</p>

    <h2>Fort Tilden</h2>
    <p>Fort Tilden is located at the south end of Rockaway Beach. It's a decommissioned military base, with some cool old buildings and abandoned bunkers that are worth checking out.</p>
    <p>To get there, take the 2 train to Brooklyn College, and then transfer to the Q35 bus. Get off at the first stop after the bridge, Beach 169th St. From there, walk south until you reach the beach.</p>
    <p>There are no lifeguards on this beach, but itâ€™s usually less crowded, and has a more relaxed feel.</p>

    <h2>Jacob Riis Beach</h2>
    <p>The Q35 bus will drop you off right at Jacob Riis Park. On the beach, there are different designated sections, including family and queer. During the summer months, youâ€™ll find lots of food vendors and live music here. Jacob Riis is also wider and more spacious than other sections of Rockaway Beach.</p>

    <h2>Other beaches</h2>
    <p>Any spot between Beach 86th Street and Beach 106th Street makes a nice visit, too. Since Hurricane Sandy, the city has renovated many buildings along the boardwalk, including public restrooms and lifeguard stations. If youâ€™re having trouble deciding where to go, take a look at the <Link to="/eat-drink">local restaurant selection</Link>. This area has lots of good spots to eat, drink, and dance.</p>

    <p>To get there, you can take the A train heading towards Far Rockaway, and transfer to the Rockaway Park Shuttle at Broad Channel. Or, you can take the 2 train to Brooklyn College and transfer to the Q35 bus. Then, at Jacob Riis Beach, transfer to the Q22 bus.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that thereâ€™s no swimming allowed at the reserved surfing spots, which are around Beach 92nd St. and Beach 67th St. You can swim discreetly on the edges of these beaches, as long as you're keeping an eye out for incoming surfers. Usually, thereâ€™s also a spot nearby reserved for swimmers only.</p>

const Surfing = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Surfing</h1>

    <h2>Beaches</h2>
    <p>Areas dedicated to surfing can be found at:
      <ul>
        <li>Beach 67th to 69th St. (the largest area for surfing)</li>
        <li>Beach 87th to 92nd St.</li>
        <li>Beach 110th to 111th St.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The A train will take you directly to Beach 67th St. (just make sure you're on a  Far Rockaway-bound A train; the Lefferts Boulevard branch doesnâ€™t go to the Rockaways). For the other beaches, take the A train to Broad Channel and switch to the shuttle train.</p>
    <p>Depending on where youâ€™re coming from, you can also take the 2 train to Brooklyn College and transfer to the Q35 bus to Riis Beach. Once you reach Riis Park, transfer to the Q22 bus, which will take you to any of these beaches.</p>

    <h2>Surf lessons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.localssurfschool.com/" target="_blank">Locals Surf School</a>, located at Beach 69th St., offers both group and individual lessons, as well as summer camp for kids.</li>
      <li><a href="http://surflessonsnewyork101.com/" target="_blank">New York Surf School</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://alohanycsurfschool.com/" target="_blank">Aloha NYC Surf School</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.boarderssurfshop.com/files/Surfing_Lessons.html" target="_blank">Boarders</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Renting equipment</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://www.localssurfschool.com/" target="_blank">Locals Surf School</a></h3>
    <p>If you text or email them a day in advance, theyâ€™ll put a foam board aside for you. You can pick it up at their tent at Beach 67th St. They're usually on the beach by 8amâ€”great if you want to ride early.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://breakwatersurfcompany.com/" target="_blank">Breakwater Surf</a></h3>
    <p>Located right by the  Beach 67th Street subway stop, they open at 8am on weekends and 9am during the week. You can choose from both foam and hard top boards in sizes between six to nine feet. They sell out quickly on summer weekends, so be sure to get there by 10:30am.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.boarderssurfshop.com/" target="_blank">Boarders Surf Shop</a></h3>
    <p>Boarders has several locations: 92nd St., 98th St., and a pop up shop at 68th Street that runs through the end of September. All locations open at 10am and offer both foam and hard top boards from six to nine feet (though the pop up shop only has larger boards).</p>


    <h2>Surfboard lockers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.boarderssurfshop.com/" target="_blank">Boarders Surf Shop</a>  offers 24/7 locker access for $70/month (92nd St.).</li>
      <li><a href="http://breakwatersurfcompany.com/" target="_blank">Breakwater Surf</a> offers locker access during operating  hours for $40/month (67th St.).</li>
      <li><a href="http://marina59.com/watersports.html" target="_blank">Marina 59</a> offers locker rentals for $75/month (59th St.).</li>
      <li>Some surfers also share tiny studios or rental shacks to store their boards.</li>
    </ul>
